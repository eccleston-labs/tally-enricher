- Implement the test form in the 'instructions' tab in /dashboard; currently it's a no-op [ ]
- Pull in the actual workspace name in the integration snippet in the same tab; don't worry about the URL for now [ ]

GABE TO DO:
- Analytics and Workspaces currently soft linked by workspace_name string, can move to ids for relational integrity.
- Indices on analytics for faster look up later.
- Add more to analytics table
